//       <p>A task tracker is an intelligent version of a to-do list that can help manage tasks and assignments. Team members can use task trackers individually or together as a team.
//       Team members can track their time as they work on each assignment on the task list, which provides helpful information for determining future costs and benchmarking. It can also alert managers if a simple task takes longer than expected so that the manager can step in and help optimize the process.
